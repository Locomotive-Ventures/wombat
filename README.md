### Overview

#### Call agent to support emergency services
Warden Wombat (previously Wombat AI) is a voice AI tool to quickly check on people's safety during disasters like floods or fires. It makes automated calls to many people, especially where mobile networks might be down. The AI can ask if they're safe, tell them about evacuations, and give them vital info quickly. It's meant to help first responders and the government reach out fast and efficiently in emergencies, making sure everyone gets the help they need.
