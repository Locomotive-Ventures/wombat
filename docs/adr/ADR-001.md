# ADR 001: Implementing a Call Agent System Using AWS Cloud Services

## Status
Accepted

## Context
For our project, we need an efficient way to make automated calls to a list of phone numbers based on user-defined scenarios. We aim to build a simple UI for inputting phone numbers and call scenarios, and an asynchronous call agent to execute these calls and report outcomes. Our key requirements are scalability, cost-efficiency, and rapid development.

## Decision
We have decided to use AWS cloud services for our project infrastructure. This decision is influenced by the availability of free credits for the hackathon and our desire to leverage AWS's Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings. The components of our architecture will include:
1. **Amazon Lex, Polly, and Connect**: To build and manage the call agent framework. Lex for natural language understanding, Polly for text-to-speech conversion, and Connect for managing call flows.
2. **DynamoDB and Lambda**: To create a serverless backend. DynamoDB for a NoSQL database solution and Lambda for handling backend logic without the need to manage servers.
3. **Next.js Frontend**: The frontend will be rapidly developed to provide the necessary user interface for inputting data. Leveraging UI libraries to speed up development.
4. **Terraform**: As our infrastructure as code in order to rapidly test, and deploy our solution.

## Consequences
This approach will allow us to quickly set up a scalable and cost-effective solution. Using AWS services ensures we can handle high volumes of calls and data processing without worrying about infrastructure. However, this approach requires familiarity with AWS services and their integration. Additionally, while serverless architecture offers scalability, it might introduce challenges in debugging and complex configurations.

## Alternatives Considered
Other cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure were considered. However, due to the availability of free AWS credits and the comprehensive suite of AWS services that fit our needs closely, we chose AWS.

## Related Decisions
N/A

## Notes
This decision is primarily driven by the hackathon's constraints and our team's familiarity with AWS services. Future considerations might include exploring hybrid cloud options or other PaaS offerings if the scope of the project expands beyond the current requirements.
