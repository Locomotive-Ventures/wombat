# ADR 003: Evaluating Alternative Solutions for Emergency Call System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our initial plan to use Amazon Connect for Wombat AI's emergency call system faced challenges, particularly in integrating custom conversational AI components. To find a more effective solution, we are exploring alternatives that offer better integration with advanced conversational AI and Text-to-Speech (TTS) capabilities.

## Decision
We have decided to evaluate the following solutions in order of priority:

1. **Vocode.dev (End-to-End Solution)**:
   - An all-inclusive platform that offers integrated TTS and conversational AI capabilities.
   - Being an end-to-end solution, it promises ease of integration and deployment.

2. **Twilio with AWS Lambda and Bedrock (Ideal Future State)**:
   - Utilize Twilio for telephony services, AWS Lambda for serverless backend processing, and Bedrock for conversational AI.
   - This approach allows leveraging Twilio's robust call handling with the flexibility and power of AWS services.

3. **Custom TTS Models with Bedrock and Twilio**:
   - Integrate custom-developed TTS models with a Large Language Model like Bedrock and Twilio for the telephony infrastructure.
   - This option provides the most control and customization but is complex and resource-intensive.

## Consequences
- **Vocode.dev** provides a simplified implementation but might limit customization and control over specific components.
- **Twilio with AWS Lambda and Bedrock** offers a balance between customization and ease of implementation, with the robustness of AWS services.
- **Custom TTS Models with Bedrock and Twilio** allows for maximum customization but involves significant complexity, development time, and potential maintenance challenges.

## Alternatives Considered
- Continuing with Amazon Connect: Dismissed due to integration complexities with custom AI components.
- Other cloud telephony services: Not considered due to Twilio's proven capabilities and existing familiarity.

## Related Decisions
- ADR 001 and ADR 002, regarding the initial choice of Amazon Connect and the use of ChatGPT for conversation prototyping.

## Notes
- These options will be trialed in the listed order, with each subsequent option considered if the preceding one does not meet our requirements.
- Close monitoring of implementation feasibility, cost, and performance will be essential in each trial phase.
