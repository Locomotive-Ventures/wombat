# ADR 006: Query DynamoDB via campaign id as a secondary index

## Status
Proposed

## Context
In order to facilitate the new design, decision is made to query DynamoDB using campaign Id rather than individual contact Ids. 
On top of it, the data needs to be parsed and if we query multiple records, there will be additional logic to return it as an array from Dynamo, then conversion to json on frontend side.

## Decision

In order to minimize effort on fronend side, we will add a lambda function between DynamoDb and API Gateway to query Dynamo using secondary index campaign Id, then parse Dynamo format into valid json, and return it via API using AWS_PROXY integration.

See updated diagram here:

## Consequences
Additional resource to maintain along with relevant Role and Invoke Permissions.

## Alternatives Considered
Considered direct integration but it would require:
- using libraries on frontend side to parse DynamoDB records to JSON;
- complex logic (not too many lines but looks bulky) for returning multiple records via direct integration.
